In tools package,

file: python_files_compiler.py => compiles python files to .exe or executables
file: test_algorithms.py => is for testing functions and algorithms
file: count_execution_time.py => is for counting time taken by a function to run (approx in microseconds)

With some changes and personialization this tools can be helpful for beginners!
I'll be adding more!
